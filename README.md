# ManhattanDistance

This code is an extension to the 8-Tile solver assignment for the "COMSM1201: Programming in C" course at the University of Bristol (UK). You can find a short description of the algorithm below.

A solver of the Eight-Tile puzzle, using Manhattan Distance heuristics to estimate the speed.
